# India-Startup-Ecosystem-Growth-Between-2018-2021

## Description
This project seeks to give insight to Fintech entrepreneurs who are interested in venturing into the start-up ecosystem and want to consider seeking funds. We will cover the key metrics to consider before making the final decision.

## Dependencies
I used python on a Jypter Notebook with the below libraries.
1. Pandas library
2. Numphy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib

## Hypothesis
**Null Hypothesis:** Fintech sector has the most funded startups in the 4 years.

**Alternate Hypothesis:** Fintech startups receive less funding as compared to other sectors.

## Excecuting the Project
The data is composed of 4 csv files which were loaded and cleaned individually before being concatenated to one large file.

The data went through a lot of cleaning in order to align to the 9 useful columns that will help in analysis.

The research questions were used to help in the analysis.
## Conclusion
Accept the null hypothesis that the Fintech Sector has the most funded start-ups in the 4 years.
